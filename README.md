# MicroPython I2S Guide and Examples for ESP32

This guide outlines the capabilities of a new MicroPython I2S class that is proposed for the MicroPython project.  The I2S class is implemented using Espressif's ESP-IDF API.

The I2S class is designed to be implemented on other MicroPython ports and follows patterns seen in the MicroPython machine module classes.

from Wikipedia:

"IÂ²S (Inter-IC Sound), pronounced eye-squared-ess, is an electrical serial bus interface standard used for connecting digital 
audio devices together. It is used to communicate PCM audio data between integrated circuits in an electronic device".

## Methods
```
I2S.init(bck, ...)
```
Initialize the I2S peripheral with the given arguments:
  * see Constructor for argument descriptions

***  
```
I2S.deinit()
```

Deinitialize the I2S peripheral

***
```
I2S.readinto(buf, [timeout = -1])
```

Read audio samples from an I2S peripheral with the given arguments:

  * **buf** receive buffer.  Must support buffer protocol, such as bytearray or array  
  * **timeout** maximum time to wait for a DMA buffer (in ms). If no DMA buffer is available in **timeout** ms the function will return. Default = wait forever to fill buf.  See discussion below on *Understanding the timeout argument* [ESP32 specific]      
  
Notes:  
  * method blocks until buf is *completely* filled from DMA memory, unless timeout is specified 
  * The DMA engine works in the background, filling DMA buffers with audio samples read from the I2S peripheral.  The MicroPython runtime is not impacted by this DMA operation.

***
```
I2S.write(buf, [timeout = -1])
```
Write audio samples to I2S peripheral with the given arguments:

  * **buf** transmit buffer.  Must support buffer protocol, such as bytearray or array
  * **timeout** maximum time to wait for a DMA buffer (in ms). If no DMA buffer is available in **timeout** ms the function will return.  Default = wait forever to write buf.  See discussion below on *Understanding the timeout argument* [ESP32 specific]      
    
Notes:  
  * method blocks until buf is *completely* copied to DMA memory, unless timeout is specified 
  * The DMA engine works in the background, transfering audio samples from DMA buffers to the I2S peripheral.  The MicroPython runtime is not impacted by this DMA operation.

### DMA considerations
The ESP32 I2S peripherals use DMA to transfer data between the user application and an external I2S hardware peripheral.  DMA memory is implemented as a linked-list of DMA buffers and is specified by the two constructor arguments `dmacount` and `dmalen`.

DMA runs continuously in the background and allows user applications to perform other operations while sample data is transfered between DMA memory and the I2S hardware. In general, more DMA memory = more time that user applications can operate before DMA "undderruns" or "overruns" happen.
  
**DMA memory allocation**

`DMA memory allocated (in bytes) = dmacount * sizeof-a-dma-buffer-in-bytes`

**Understanding DMA buffer size**

It is intuitive to think that `sizeof-a-dma-buffer-in-bytes` equals `dmalen`. **This is not the case**.  `dmalen` is related to the number of data *samples*.  `sizeof-a-dma-buffer-in-bytes` is calculated as follows:

`sizeof-a-dma-buffer-in-bytes = dmalen * # bytes/sample * # channels`

where `# channels` refers to mono versus stereo operation:
  * mono = 1 channel, (channelformat=ONLY_RIGHT, ONLY_LEFT)
  * stereo = 2 channels, (channelformat=RIGHT_LEFT, ALL_RIGHT, or ALL_LEFT)

example:  dmalen=128, dataformat=32bits, channelformat=RIGHT_LEFT (e.g. stereo)
  * sizeof-a-dma-buffer-in-bytes = 128 \* 4 \* 2 = 1024 bytes

**Sizing 'buf' for readinto()**:  For efficient use of allocated memory, the sizeof `buf` should be an integer multiple of the DMA buffer size.  Larger `buf` sizes can be advantageous when writing samples to internal flash memory or external SDCards.  A larger `buf` will permit a continuous bulk write to memory, which is more efficient than multiple small block writes. 

**Sizing 'buf' for write()**:  Similar to the read() method, the sizeof `buf` should be an integer multiple of the DMA buffer size.  For a *simple* design using the `timeout` argument, the sizeof `buf` can be equal to the sizeof the DMA buffer.  Why? The entire contents of `buf` can be written to a DMA memory buffer in one pass, which avoids possible design complications of dealing with residual samples remaining in `buf`.

### Understanding the timeout argument
The optional `timeout` argument in the readinto and write methods specifies the maximum amount of time (in ms) that these method calls wait for a DMA buffer to become available. If `timeout = 0` is specified, then the readinto and write methods will return "immediately" (measured ~125us) when:
  * no DMA buffer is available with data to read (readinto method)
  * no DMA buffer is available to be filled (write method) 
  
The `timeout` argument allows application code to effectively poll DMA memory and then perform other operations when all DMA buffers are empty (readinto method) or full (write method).

### Understanding the Channel Format argument
The `channelformat` constructor argument determines how sample data is mapped to the sdin, sdout, and bck I2S signals.  The relationships can be understood through example, showing oscilloscope captures of the relevant I2S signals.

The following oscilloscope captures use data contained in the following WAV file:

../wav_files/pattern-16k-32bits.wav

The first sample starts at byte 44 (00 00 00 FF).  WAV data is little endian format.  In the images below, the sample values are indicated below the SDOUT signal (e.g, "0xFF 00 00 00", etc). 

**channelformat = RIGHT_LEFT**

Example:  output stereo audio data to an I2S DAC device that supports 2 channels (stereo)

![RIGHT_LEFT](images/RIGHT_LEFT.PNG)

**channelformat = ALL_LEFT**

Example:  output Left channel stereo audio data to an I2S DAC device that supports 1 channel

![ALL_LEFT](images/ALL_LEFT.PNG)

**channelformat = ALL_RIGHT**

Example:  output Right channel stereo audio data to an I2S DAC device that supports 1 channel

![ALL_RIGHT](images/ALL_RIGHT.PNG)

**channelformat = ONLY_LEFT or ONLY_RIGHT**

Example:  output audio data to an I2S DAC device that supports 1 channel

![ONLY_LEFT](images/ONLY_LEFT.PNG)

### Enhancements to consider
The initial I2S class implementation is a "minimum viable product" (MVP).  It offers basic capabilities to implement many audio I2S applications.  Based on feedback, enhancements can be considered, including:
  * full duplex
  * slave mode
  * non-blocking read and write with callback on completion
  * uasyncio implementation
  * stream protocol implemention
  * exposing I2S events to detect gaps in the sample stream.  e.g. underrun (Master Tx) and overrun (Master Rx) in DMA buffering
  
Many enhancements will require implementation at the ESP32 I2S register level.  I2S registers are described in the ESP32 Technical Reference Manual.  Register descriptions are minimal, but the existing ESP-IDF I2S API code can be reverse-engineered for a more complete understanding.

### MicroPython examples
MicroPython code is contained in the *examples* folder.  WAV files used in the examples are contained in the *wav_files* folder
#### 1. Play mono WAV file using Adafruit I2S 3W Class D Amplifier Breakout - MAX98357A
MicroPython code:
  * play-mono-wav.py

WAV files (copy to file system using rshell, ampy, etc)
  * taunt-16k-16bits-mono.wav
  * taunt-16k-16bits-mono-12db.wav  (-12db version)

#### 2. Play stereo WAV file using I2S PCM5102 Stereo DAC Decoder
MicroPython code:
  * play-stereo-wav.py

WAV file  (copy to file system using rshell, ampy, etc):
  * side-to-side-8k-16bits-stereo.wav

#### 3. Record 16 bit audio to SDCard WAV file using Adafruit I2S MEMS Microphone Breakout - SPH0645LM4H
MicroPython code:
  * read-mic-write-external-sdcard.py

Note: imports sdcard.py.  Copy sdcard.py into filesystem from micropython/drivers/sdcard folder 

#### 4. Record 16 bit audio to internal filesystem using INMP441 Microphone
MicroPython code:
  * read-mono-mic-write-internal-flash.py

Notes:  
  * Compared to example 3, this implementation uses 1/4 the DMA memory and does not require a prune() function.  Credit:  @MikeShi42 
  * The `ampy` tool has a bug that prevents binary files from being downloaded from the filesystem.  See issue:
  https://github.com/pycampers/ampy/issues/45.

#### 5. Record 32 bit audio to SDCard WAV file using Adafruit I2S MEMS Microphone Breakout - SPH0645LM4H
MicroPython code:
  * read-mono-mic-write-external-sdcard-32bits.py

Notes: 
  * imports sdcard.py.  Copy sdcard.py into filesystem from micropython/drivers/sdcard folder
  * uses efficient DMA configuration.  Credit:  @MikeShi42 

### Building a psRAM version of MicroPython
To use ESP32 development boards supporting external psRAM memory (e.g.  Lolin D32 Pro with 4MB of psRAM) you will need to change the MicroPython build environment as follows:
  * include make variable `SDKCONFIG = boards/sdkconfig.spiram` in the command line call for make.  For example, `make deploy SDKCONFIG = boards/sdkconfig.spiram`
  
after this change perform a one-time `make clean` and then build
